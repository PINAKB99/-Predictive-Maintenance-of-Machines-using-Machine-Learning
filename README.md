# -Predictive-Maintenance-of-Machines-using-Machine-Learning
The "Predictive Maintenance of Bearing Machines" project marks an important step forward in applying machine learning for industrial optimization
developed by PINAK-VYAS.This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict faults in bearing machines, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing operational downtime. The predictive models are trained on the Case Western Reserve University's bearing dataset, with a focus on analyzing vibrations and other performance signals from the fan and drive ends of the machine.
A critical component of the project is the use of confusion matrices to evaluate the accuracy of predictions. This ensures that the predictions made by the trained models align closely with the actual conditions of the machines, effectively comparing the dataset-based predictions with company-provided assessments. Algorithms such as logistic and linear regression were employed for classification, ensuring high reliability and interpretability in fault detection.
PINAK played an integral role in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, as well as deploying robust evaluation frameworks. This project provides a cutting-edge solution for industries, allowing for accurate maintenance scheduling and improved operational efficiency through predictive insights
